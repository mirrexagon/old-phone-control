## Requirements
- Box that connects to computer via USB, ideally bus-powered
- Box connects on the other side to the 600-series phone connector
- USB exposes:
    - Audio class
        - Phone microphone
        - Phone speaker
        - (Think about how both voices go on one line)
- HID keyboard â€“ outputs 0-9 from dialing
- Off-hook detection, send as button?

## Notes
- Need to supply 36-48 V on the phone line?
- When off hook, resistor load is applied to drop voltage to <10 V
- Can try using an old phone-VOIP modem for a phone line simulator I can probe
